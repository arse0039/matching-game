# Matching Game

# What it Does

The program generates an N x M board with (N*M)/2 hidden colors. It recognizes user clicks, allowing the player to reveal two tiles at a time. If the colors match, the tiles remain revealed, otherwise they flip back after a set period of time.
Players can choose to play the game on either Easy (4 x 5 board with longer reveal time) or Hard (5 x 6 board with shorter reveal time) modes.
